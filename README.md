# NDNOverWifiDirect

A simple implementation of an interface that provides common access to the
Android implementation of NFD, and affords communication between Android
devices over WiFi Direct. Branch master-v2 holds a different underlying protocol.

Currently, there is a sample application that uses this interface found
in the src/main/.../videosharing/ package.
